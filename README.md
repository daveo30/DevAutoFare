Google-Directions-Android


The sample makes use of the Google Places API for Android in order to provide a real life example of how the library can be used.[You can check it out on the store.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.directions.sample)

Download
--------


Grab via Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.jd-alexander</groupId>
  <artifactId>library</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
or Gradle:
```groovy
    compile 'com.github.jd-alexander:library:1.1.0'
```

Usage
-----

To calculate the route you simply instantiate a Routing object and trigger the execute function.


*You can execute the task in this manner. ( See the example for more details on the exact implementation)



``` java

        Routing routing = new Routing.Builder()
                    .travelMode(/* Travel Mode */)
                    .withListener(/* Listener that delivers routing results.*/)
                    .waypoints(/*waypoints*/)
                    .key(/*api key for quota management*/)
                    .build();
        routing.execute();
